## Spring Boot Project Three-Layer Architecture  
Presentation layer/API Layer: This is the user interface of the application that presents the applicationâ€™s features and data to the user.  
  
Business/Service layer: This layer contains the business logic that drives the applicationâ€™s core functionalities. Like making decisions, calculations, evaluations, and processing the data passing between the other two layers.  
  
Data access object (DAO) layer: This layer is responsible for interacting with databases to save and restore application data.  
  
Example: "demo" project  


## Dockerizing a Spring Boot Application

FROM: As the base for our image, we'll take the Java-enabled Alpine Linux created in the previous section.  
COPY: We let Docker copy our jar file into the image.  
ENTRYPOINT: This will be the executable to start when the container is booting. We must define them as JSON-Array because we'll use an ENTRYPOINT in combination with a CMD for some application arguments.  

Dockerfile =[docker build]=> Docker image =[docker run]=> Docker container
